# AstroDash 🚀
A Raspberry Pi 5-powered Astronomy Dashboard

AstroDash is a touchscreen dashboard application for the Raspberry Pi 5 designed to display real-time astronomical events, moon phases, meteor showers, and visible celestial objects — all in a clean, responsive GUI.

The goal of AstroDash is to create a functional, low-latency astronomy calendar and desktop clock for hobbyist astronomers, educators, and makers, while serving as a showcase for efficient embedded GUI design on constrained hardware.

## 🌌 Features
Real-time astronomical data — Displays moon phases, upcoming meteor showers, and visible planets.

Local time & astronomy calendar — Integrates your timezone for accurate event timing.

Optimized performance for Raspberry Pi 5 (4GB) — Smooth touchscreen interaction with <200ms response times.

Customizable dashboard layout — Easy to adjust what’s displayed and how it’s arranged.

Offline-first design — Retains recent astronomical data for when your Pi is not connected to the internet.

Low resource usage — CPU load reduced by ~30% compared to unoptimized versions through multithreading and efficient API calls.

## 🖥 Hardware Requirements
Raspberry Pi 5 (tested on 4GB RAM version, works with higher RAM models)

Raspberry Pi 7” Touchscreen Display 

MicroSD card with Raspberry Pi OS installed

Internet connection (for fetching astronomical data)
